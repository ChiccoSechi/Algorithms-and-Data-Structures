    "# Graph Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook on Graph Algorithms! This notebook is designed to provide a detailed introduction to graph algorithms, which are critical for solving a wide variety of problems in computer science, from network routing to social network analysis. Understanding these algorithms is essential for developing efficient solutions to problems involving connected data, such as paths, cycles, and connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize some of the graph algorithms, you can explore this interactive tool: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html or https://visualgo.net/en\n",
    "### What Are Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are data structures consisting of **nodes** (also called vertices) and **edges** that connect these nodes. They are used to represent relationships or connections between entities. Graphs can model anything from road networks and social media connections to dependency graphs in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs come in different forms, based on the direction and weight of edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directed Graphs**: In a directed graph, edges have a direction, meaning a connection from node A to node B does not imply a connection from B to A.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Undirected Graphs**: In undirected graphs, edges have no direction, meaning a connection between nodes is bidirectional.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Weighted Graphs**: In weighted graphs, edges have weights (or costs), often representing distances or costs associated with traversing the edge.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Unweighted Graphs**: Unweighted graphs treat all edges equally, with no associated cost or weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Graph Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover essential graph algorithms, which solve different problems related to traversal, shortest paths, connectivity, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A traversal algorithm that explores nodes layer by layer, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An exploration algorithm that dives deep into the graph, exploring as far as possible before backtracking, useful for cycle detection and pathfinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Topological Sort**: Orders nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, A comes before B in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: A shortest path algorithm that handles graphs with negative weights and detects negative-weight cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: A dynamic programming approach to finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental concepts and applications of graph algorithms.\n",
    "- Learn how to implement and apply these algorithms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Graphs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, graphs can be represented in several ways, with two of the most common being **adjacency lists** and **adjacency matrices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency List**: In this representation, each node in the graph has a list of its adjacent (connected) nodes. This method is memory efficient, especially for sparse graphs, where most nodes have only a few connections. It is implemented using dictionaries or lists, where the key (or index) represents the node, and the value is a list of neighboring nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example of an undirected graph using an adjacency list:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  graph = {\n",
    "      'A': ['B', 'C'],\n",
    "      'B': ['A', 'D'],\n",
    "      'C': ['A', 'D'],\n",
    "      'D': ['B', 'C']\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix**: In an adjacency matrix, a 2D array is used to represent the graph. Each row and column represent nodes, and the value at `matrix[i][j]` indicates whether there is an edge between node `i` and node `j` (1 if an edge exists, 0 if it does not). For weighted graphs, the matrix can store the edge weights instead of just 1s and 0s. This representation is particularly useful for dense graphs, where most nodes are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example of an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  graph = [\n",
    "    #  A  B  C  D\n",
    "      [0, 1, 1, 0], # A\n",
    "      [1, 0, 0, 1], # B\n",
    "      [1, 0, 0, 1], # C\n",
    "      [0, 1, 1, 0]  # D\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of graph representation depends on the problem you are solving. Adjacency lists are typically more space-efficient for sparse graphs, while adjacency matrices offer faster lookups when checking for the presence of an edge between two nodes in dense graphs."

    "## Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph data structures. It explores the graph layer by layer, starting from a specified node (called the source or starting node), and visiting all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is widely used in various applications such as shortest-path algorithms, networking, and finding connected components in a graph.\n",
    "BFS can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### BFS Structure and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting Point:** BFS starts at a specific node, called the source node. From this node, it explores all its neighbors (nodes directly connected to it) before moving on to their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Queue Structure:** BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be explored. The first node to be explored is enqueued, and when visited, its neighbors are added to the queue. The algorithm continues dequeuing nodes from the front of the queue and enqueuing their unvisited neighbors until the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visited Set:** To avoid revisiting nodes and getting stuck in cycles, BFS maintains a list (or set) of visited nodes. As each node is visited, it is marked as visited, ensuring that it will not be explored again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Layered Exploration:** BFS explores nodes in layers:\n",
    "   - **Level 0**: The starting node.\n",
    "   - **Level 1**: All direct neighbors of the starting node.\n",
    "   - **Level 2**: All nodes that are neighbors of nodes at Level 1, and so on.\n",
    "   This layer-by-layer exploration ensures that the shortest path to each node is found in an unweighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How BFS Operates\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following syntax to manage node visits:\n",
    "- **White**: The node has not been discovered yet.\n",
    "- **Grey**: The node has been discovered but has not been fully explored yet.\n",
    "- **Black (Black)**: The node has been fully explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Mark the starting node as visited.\n",
    "   - Add the starting node to the queue.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue (this node is currently being explored).\n",
    "   - For each unvisited neighbor of this node:\n",
    "     - Mark it as visited.\n",
    "     - Add it to the queue.\n",
    "   - Repeat this process until the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination:** The algorithm terminates when all reachable nodes have been visited, and the queue becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BFS Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs:** BFS finds the shortest path between the starting node and all other nodes in an unweighted graph, as the first time a node is visited corresponds to the shortest path to that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level Order Traversal:** BFS can be used to explore nodes by levels, making it suitable for level-order traversal of trees or exploring all nodes that are reachable within a certain number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connected Components:** In an undirected graph, BFS can be used to identify all connected components by running the algorithm from each unvisited node, effectively exploring all nodes in a component before moving to another component.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cycle Detection:** In certain scenarios, BFS can be used to detect cycles in graphs, particularly in undirected graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search is a fundamental algorithm used to explore graphs in a breadthward manner, meaning it explores all nodes at a certain distance from the source before moving further. By using a queue and tracking visited nodes, BFS efficiently finds the shortest paths in unweighted graphs, makes level-order traversals possible, and solves many practical problems in graph theory."

    "## Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal and search algorithm that explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a given node (called the source node) and explores each path in the graph as far as it can go before returning to explore other paths.\n",
    "DFS can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### DFS Structure and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting Point:** DFS begins at a specified node, known as the source node. From this node, the algorithm explores as far as possible along each path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stack Structure:** DFS can be implemented using recursion (which uses the call stack internally). In the recursive version, function calls manage the stack implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visited Set:** DFS keeps track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting the same node and getting stuck in cycles. Once a node is visited, it is marked, ensuring it wonâ€™t be processed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deep Exploration:** DFS prioritizes going as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking. It moves to an unvisited neighbor of the current node, pushing the current node onto the stack for backtracking purposes. When no unvisited neighbors are left, DFS pops nodes from the stack, returning to the previous node to explore other paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DFS Operates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Mark the starting node as visited.\n",
    "   - Push the starting node onto the stack (or make the initial recursive call).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Until all nodes have been recursively explored:\n",
    "     - Process the current recursive call.\n",
    "     - For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:\n",
    "       - Mark it as visited.\n",
    "       - Recursively call DFS with the neighbor as the new node.\n",
    "   - Continue this process until all nodes reachable from the starting node have been visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination:** DFS finishes when all possible paths from the starting node have been explored. If any nodes remain unvisited, DFS can be restarted from an unvisited node to explore disconnected parts of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DFS Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pathfinding and Connectivity:** DFS can be used to determine whether a path exists between two nodes in a graph. It also identifies connected components in undirected graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cycle Detection:** DFS can detect cycles in both directed and undirected graphs. By keeping track of visited nodes and the recursion stack, DFS can determine if there is a back edge that forms a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solving Mazes and Puzzle Problems:** DFS is used in puzzles like mazes, where the goal is to explore all possible paths until a solution is found, or all paths have been exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-First Search is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as deep as possible in each direction before backtracking. DFSâ€™s deep exploration and backtracking approach make it ideal for problems requiring the traversal of all possible paths or the identification of specific patterns within a graph."

    "## Topological Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological Ordering (or Topological Sort) is a linear ordering of the vertices in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** such that for every directed edge \\( u \\to v \\), vertex \\( u \\) comes before vertex \\( v \\) in the ordering. In other words, it arranges the vertices of the graph in a sequence where each node appears before all the nodes it points to. Topological ordering is used in scheduling problems, dependency resolution, and understanding precedence relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Topological Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Topological sorting is only possible for graphs that are directed and acyclic. If a cycle exists in the graph, a topological order cannot be defined because no linear ordering can satisfy the dependency represented by the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partial Order:** The result of topological sorting is not necessarily unique. A graph may have multiple valid topological orders if there are nodes that are not directly dependent on one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Precedence Relations:** In a topological order, if there is an edge \\( u \\to v \\), vertex \\( u \\) must appear before vertex \\( v \\) in the ordering, ensuring that any dependencies are respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Topological Ordering Operates\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common algorithms used to produce a topological ordering of a graph: **Kahn's Algorithm** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)-based Topological Sort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (Iterative Approach):**\n",
    "Kahnâ€™s Algorithm is an iterative method that uses the concept of **in-degree** (the number of incoming edges to a node) to perform a topological sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-degree Calculation:** Start by calculating the in-degree of all nodes in the graph. Nodes with zero in-degree have no dependencies and can be processed first.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Queue Initialization:** Initialize a queue with all nodes that have an in-degree of zero, as they can be placed first in the topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Nodes:** While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Remove a node from the queue and add it to the topological ordering.\n",
    "   - For each neighbor of this node (each node it points to), reduce its in-degree by one.\n",
    "   - If any neighborâ€™s in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination:** The process continues until the queue is empty. If all nodes are processed, a valid topological order is obtained. If there are unprocessed nodes and the queue is empty, the graph contains a cycle, and topological sorting is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **DFS-Based Topological Sort (Recursive Approach):**\n",
    "This method uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to explore the graph and derive a topological ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DFS Traversal:** Perform a DFS starting from an unvisited node. During the traversal, explore each nodeâ€™s neighbors (its descendants).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Post-Order Processing:** Once all descendants of a node are visited, add the node to a stack. This ensures that a node is only added to the stack after all its dependencies have been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Topological Order:** Once all nodes have been visited, pop nodes from the stack to get the topological order. This works because nodes are added in post-order, meaning all dependencies are added to the stack before the node itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cycle Detection:** During the DFS traversal, a cycle can be detected by checking if a node is being visited while already in the recursion stack. If such a cycle is found, topological sorting is impossible for that graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Topological Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Scheduling:** Topological sorting is widely used in scheduling tasks that have dependencies. For example, tasks in a project might have prerequisites, and a topological order can help identify the sequence in which tasks should be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Course Prerequisites:** In academic course planning, topological sort can determine the order in which courses should be taken, ensuring that prerequisites are completed before advanced courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dependency Resolution:** In systems like package managers, where certain software packages depend on others, topological sorting helps resolve dependencies, ensuring that required packages are installed before the dependent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compiling Source Code:** In compilation, files that depend on other files must be compiled in the correct order. A topological sort helps to find this order, ensuring that dependencies are respected during compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological Ordering arranges the nodes of a directed acyclic graph in a linear sequence where each node precedes all the nodes it points to. Using algorithms like Kahnâ€™s Algorithm or DFS-based topological sort, the vertices are ordered while respecting dependencies. This ordering is crucial in many real-world scenarios, such as task scheduling, dependency resolution, and course planning. While topological sorting works only for DAGs, it provides a powerful tool for managing precedence relations in various applications."

    "Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of Dijkstra's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Negative Weights:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm works only with graphs that have non-negative edge weights. It cannot correctly compute shortest paths if negative weights are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Greedy Approach:** The algorithm builds the shortest path tree by continuously selecting the vertex with the smallest tentative distance, updating the distances of its neighboring vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm typically employs a priority queue (often implemented with a min-heap) to efficiently select the vertex with the smallest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Dijkstra's Algorithm Operates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Set the distance to the source vertex to zero and all other vertices to infinity.\n",
    "   - Mark all vertices as unvisited. Initialize a priority queue and add the source vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relaxation Process:**\n",
    "   - While there are unvisited vertices in the priority queue:\n",
    "     - Extract the vertex with the smallest distance (let's call it the current vertex).\n",
    "     - For each unvisited neighbor of the current vertex:\n",
    "       - Calculate the tentative distance from the source to the neighbor through the current vertex.\n",
    "       - If this tentative distance is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and set the current vertex as the predecessor of the neighbor.\n",
    "       - Add the neighbor to the priority queue with the updated distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination:** The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been visited or the priority queue is empty. The shortest path from the source to each vertex is now known."

    "### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Unlike single-source shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall computes the shortest paths between every pair of vertices simultaneously. This algorithm works for both directed and undirected graphs and can handle graphs with negative edge weights, provided there are no negative weight cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All-Pairs Shortest Paths:** The algorithm computes the shortest path between all pairs of vertices, not just from a single source. It fills out a distance matrix where each entry represents the shortest path from vertex \\( i \\) to vertex \\( j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** The Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to iteratively improve the shortest path estimates. It considers whether an intermediate vertex can provide a shorter path between two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles Negative Weights:** Floyd-Warshall can handle negative edge weights. However, if a negative weight cycle exists, the algorithm can detect it by checking for negative values on the diagonal of the distance matrix after computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterative Updates:** The algorithm updates the distances by examining each vertex as a potential intermediate vertex between all pairs of nodes. If including this intermediate vertex results in a shorter path, the distance is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Operates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Create a distance matrix \\( D \\) where each entry \\( D[i][j] \\) represents the initial distance from vertex \\( i \\) to vertex \\( j \\).\n",
    "     - If there is an edge between \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), set \\( D[i][j] \\) to the weight of that edge.\n",
    "     - If \\( i = j \\), set \\( D[i][j] = 0 \\) (distance from a node to itself is zero).\n",
    "     - If there is no edge between \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), set \\( D[i][j] \\) to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Step (Three Nested Loops):**\n",
    "   - The algorithm considers every vertex \\( k \\) as a potential intermediate vertex.\n",
    "   - For each pair of vertices \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), the algorithm checks if the path from \\( i \\) to \\( j \\) through \\( k \\) is shorter than the previously known shortest path \\( D[i][j] \\).\n",
    "   - If so, update \\( D[i][j] \\) as \\( D[i][j] = \\min(D[i][j], D[i][k] + D[k][j]) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   The three nested loops iterate over all vertices to update the shortest path between every pair of vertices using each vertex as an intermediate point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Negative Cycle Detection:**\n",
    "   - After completing the updates, check the diagonal of the distance matrix \\( D \\). If any diagonal element \\( D[i][i] \\) is negative, this indicates the presence of a **negative weight cycle** in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination:** After all iterations are completed, the distance matrix \\( D \\) contains the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Each entry \\( D[i][j] \\) represents the shortest distance from vertex \\( i \\) to vertex \\( j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shortest Paths in Dense Graphs:** Floyd-Warshall is efficient for dense graphs, where most pairs of nodes are connected, as it computes all-pairs shortest paths in \\( O(n^3) \\) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detecting Negative Weight Cycles:** Since the algorithm can detect negative weight cycles, it is useful in applications where such cycles need to be identified and handled, such as in financial modeling or currency arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm that calculates the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a graph. Using a dynamic programming approach, it iteratively improves path estimates by considering each vertex as a potential intermediate step. The algorithm works for both directed and undirected graphs, handles negative edge weights, and can detect negative weight cycles. With wide applications in graph analysis, Floyd-Warshall provides an efficient solution to the all-pairs shortest path problem."

    "**Time Complexity: $O(V + E)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores nodes in layers, starting from a source node and visiting all its neighbors before moving on to the next level. Here, $V$ represents the number of vertices and $E$ represents the number of edges in the graph. The algorithm ensures that every vertex and edge is explored once, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the size of the graph.\n",

    "### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "**Time Complexity: $O(V + E)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS is an exploration algorithm that dives deep into the graph, exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Similar to BFS, the time complexity is $O(V + E)$, as it visits each vertex and edge once during the traversal, making it efficient for various applications, including cycle detection and pathfinding.\n",

    "\n",
    "Topological Sort is used to order the nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node $A$ to node $B$, $A$ precedes $B$ in the ordering. The algorithm can be implemented using either BFS (Kahn's Algorithm) or DFS, both of which operate in linear time relative to the number of vertices and edges.\n",

    "Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. It efficiently uses a priority queue to retrieve the next node with the smallest distance. The algorithmâ€™s complexity depends on the implementation of the priority queue; with a binary heap, it takes $O((V + E) \\log V)$ time.\n",

    "The Bellman-Ford Algorithm computes the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes, accommodating graphs with negative weights. It iteratively relaxes the edges, updating the shortest paths for $V-1$ iterations, where $V$ is the number of vertices. Thus, the overall time complexity is $O(V \\cdot E)$.\n",

    "The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm calculates the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes using dynamic programming. It involves three nested loops, iterating through all pairs of vertices for each possible intermediate vertex. This results in a cubic time complexity of $O(V^3)$, making it suitable for dense graphs or when all-pairs shortest paths are required.\n"
