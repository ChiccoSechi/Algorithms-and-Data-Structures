### Description 
These notes are all in Jupyter Notebook format. Each file includes a brief description of various algorithms and data structures, followed by their code implementation and usage examples. At the end of each file, you'll find a short explanation of the time complexity for each algorithm discussed.

### Installation
To use the Jupyter Notebook files, you'll need to install Jupyter Notebook first. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Next, clone the GitHub repository. You can do this directly from GitHub by clicking the "Code" button and then selecting "Download ZIP," or you can clone it from the terminal using this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChiccoSechi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures.git
cd Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
```

Finally, open Jupyter Notebook to view and use the materials:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

There's no need to install a requirements.txt file because all the libraries used are from python standard.
