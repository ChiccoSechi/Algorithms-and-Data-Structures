    "# Search Algorithms  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook on Searching Algorithms! This notebook is designed to provide a thorough introduction to various searching algorithms, which are essential techniques in computer science for finding specific elements within data structures. Mastering searching algorithms is crucial for optimizing performance in many applications, including databases, web search engines, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Searching Algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching algorithms are methods used to locate specific elements or values within a data structure, such as an array, linked list, or tree. Different searching algorithms are suited to different types of data structures and use cases, offering various trade-offs in terms of speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the following key searching algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Search**: Checks each element sequentially until the target is found or the list ends. Simple but can be slow for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half. It narrows down the search to quickly locate the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Jump Search**: Jumps ahead by fixed steps in a sorted array and performs a linear search within the block where the target might be. Balances linear and binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpolation Search**: Estimates the target's position based on its value relative to the arrayâ€™s range. More efficient for uniformly distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponential Search**: Searches by expanding intervals exponentially and then applies binary search within the identified range. Useful for unbounded lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fibonacci Search**: Uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the array and search for the target. An alternative to binary search with unique partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the basic concepts and operations of each searching algorithm.\n",
    "- Learn how to implement these searching algorithms in Python."

    "## Binary Search\n",
    "Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Initially, it checks the middle element of the array. If the middle element matches the target value, the search is complete. If the target value is smaller, the search continues in the lower half of the array, and if it is larger, in the upper half. This process continues until the target value is found or the interval is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm outputs the index of the target element if it is found, otherwise it indicates that the element is not present in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search only works with arrays that are sorted in ascending or descending order. There are two main versions of Binary Search: iterative and recursive. The **iterative version** uses a loop to divide the array and adjust the search interval. In contrast, the **recursive version** calls itself with a reduced interval until the base case is met, either finding the element or exhausting the search space. Both versions have the same time complexity of O(log n), but the iterative version generally uses less memory, as it doesn't involve multiple recursive calls."

    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1. **Fibonacci Number Setup:** Identify the smallest Fibonacci number greater than or equal to the size of the array. Let this number be `F(k)`, where `F(k)` is the k-th Fibonacci number.\n",
    "2. **Initial Positioning:** Set the initial offset to -1 and the two pointers `i` and `j` to `F(k-2)` and `F(k-1)`, respectively, where `F(k-2)` is the (k-2)-th Fibonacci number and `F(k-1)` is the (k-1)-th Fibonacci number.\n",
    "3. **Iterative Search:** While the Fibonacci number used (starting with `F(k-2)`) is greater than 1:\n",
    "   - Compare the element at index `min(offset + F(k-2), n-1)` with the target.\n",
    "   - If the element matches, the search is complete.\n",
    "   - If the target is less than the compared element, the search moves to the left, reducing `F(k)` to `F(k-2)`.\n",
    "   - If the target is greater, the offset is moved to `offset + F(k-2)`, and the search continues on the right, reducing `F(k)` to `F(k-1)` and `F(k-1)` to `F(k-2)`.\n",
    "4. **Final Check:** If the remaining element (at index `offset + 1`) matches the target, return the index; otherwise, indicate that the target is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci Search requires that the array be sorted. It is especially effective for arrays where the size of each access is proportional to the index, such as in databases or certain types of file systems. The algorithm outputs the index of the target element if found or indicates the absence of the element otherwise."

    "**Time Complexity: $O(n)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a linear search, the algorithm iterates through the array element by element, comparing each element with the search value. In the worst case, it has to check all the elements, so if there are $ n $ elements in the array, the execution time is proportional to $ n $. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Search\n",
    "**Time Complexity: $O(\\log n)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search works on sorted arrays. The algorithm splits the array in half at each step and compares the middle element with the search value. If the search value is smaller, it focuses on the left half; otherwise, it focuses on the right half. This halving process continues until the element is found or the search range becomes empty. Since the array is halved each time, the number of operations required is logarithmic relative to the number of elements, resulting in a time complexity of $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jump Search\n",
    "**Time Complexity: $O(\\sqrt{n})$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump search is a variant of linear search but moves through the array in fixed jumps (typically the square root of the array size). If the target element is not found within the jumped block, a linear search is conducted within that block. Choosing the jump length as $\\sqrt{n}$ balances the jumps and linear searches, resulting in a time complexity of $O(\\sqrt{n})$.\n",

    "### Interpolation Search\n",
    "**Time Complexity: $O(\\log \\log n)$ on average, $O(n)$ in the worst case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation search is efficient on uniformly distributed sorted arrays. It uses an interpolation formula to estimate the position of the search value, rather than splitting the array in half as in binary search. In the average case, when elements are uniformly distributed, the complexity is $O(\\log \\log n)$. However, if the data is unevenly distributed or the search value is far from the central distribution, the complexity can degrade to $O(n)$.\n",

    "**Time Complexity: $O(\\log n)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential search is effective for finding the range in which to search for an element in a sorted array. It starts from an index and doubles the index at each step until finding a value greater than or equal to the search value. Once the range is found, binary search is used. The number of steps needed to double is logarithmic, so the overall time complexity is $O(\\log n)$.\n",

    "### Fibonacci Search\n",
    "**Time Complexity: $O(\\log n)$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci search is similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to determine the subarrays to examine. Fibonacci numbers are used to create partitions within the array, reducing the search range similarly to binary search. Since the array is divided logarithmically, the time complexity is $O(\\log n)$.\n",
